Thanks to colleagues who -- while much more worthy of the conference -- were unable to attend WWDC at the last minute, I got to use their hand-me-down lottery ticket to go to my first Developers Conference in San Jose.  Here are some of my favorite WWDC17 sessions:

* [Introducing Drag and Drop](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc17/203) — They go deep on this new feature in iOS11 and give an cool demo of all the multi-hand/multi-finger chording techniques

* [Introducing Core ML](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc17/703) — Apple is making machine learning something easy to incorporate into apps. So they’re not trying to reinvent the training process, but they are [definitely making consumption of already-trained models as easy as drag-and-drop](http://deepdojo.com/apple-introduces-core-ml).  This session was a good primer on how to incorporate a model in your code

* [Natural Language Processing and your Apps](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc17/208) — This session helped me walk thorough how you use NSLinguisticTagger and I got to play around with it in Swift Playgrounds down in the labs

* [Designing Sound](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc17/803) — This was a brilliant session with many familiar sounds that showed the power of sound design

* [Essential Design Principles](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc17/802) — The design team shared lots of principles, but I really enjoyed the “Design Shorts” sessions where topic after topic were presented for 10 minutes a piece.  Here are some good ones:

    * [60 Second Prototyping](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/818/)
    * [Designing Glyphs](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/823/) 
    * [Rich Notifications](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/817/) 
    * [How to Pick a Custom Font](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/815/)
    * [What’s New in iOS: Wayfinding, Typographic Hierarchy, Contrast](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/810)
    * [App Icon Design](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/822/)
    * [Communication Between Designers and Engineers](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/809)
    * [Love at First Launch](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/816/)

* [Convenience for You is Independence for Me](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc17/110) — [The Quadfather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PoE9tHg_P0) spoke in-person about his experience and the importance of accessibility


There are many more video recordings from WWDC17 and previous conferences, and they're all available in the WWDC app as well.
