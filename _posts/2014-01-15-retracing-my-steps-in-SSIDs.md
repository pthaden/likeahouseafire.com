At home I've got more than one wifi network.  No real reason, except that I've got more than one brand of wireless router and so I've set up the 802.11ac networks with a different SSID than the older 802.11n networks. 

Whenever my MacBook falls off the network (coming back online, getting out of and back into range, etc), I noticed that the network connection defaults to the slower SSID.  But my preference would be to hop back onto the faster network.

This is an easy fix:  for some reason I've gotten my newer network listed lower in the list of Preferred Networks in `System Preferences >> Network >> Wi-Fi >> Advanced >> Wi-Fi` and I just need to drag it up to the top of the list.

However, when I went in there I found a list of nearly every wifi network I've ever joined.  There were network names from coffee shops, hotel chains, airports, hotspots, you name it.  I'm usually on our corporate VPN, so the brief amount of time I spend connected to these public networks doesn't bother me too much.

In fact, I started to recognize some of the oddly-named wifi networks and remembered the trips I was on when I must have connected in those locations.  How strange is it to travel down memory lane by the names of your wifi hotspots?
